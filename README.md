### Acoustics Simulation and Laboratory Characteristics of Percussive Instruments
Research Adviser: Michael Robinson at American University

Students: Robert Green, Gregory Young, Fangfei Lan

The research aims to understand the relationship between the elasticity and acoustics of a percussive instrument. It is divided into two sections: **Acoustics Simulation** and **Laboratory Characteristics**.

This repository consists of a python 2.7 acoustics simulation of percussive instruments, a auto cropper for raw acoustics data and a few analyzers.

* Simulation - The simulation provides a python interface that takes stl files as inputs and outputs a wav file as the predicted sound.
* Auto Cropper - The auto cropper crops raw acoustics data to a customized standard.
* Analyzers - The analyzer provides different methods of comparing and contrasting wav files.
